# How searches with RAGs work

A good intro

> In practice, the process is a bit more involved:
> 
> Documents in a knowledge base are divided into smaller chunks.
> An embedding model is used to “vectorize” these chunks.
> These vectors are indexed into a vector database.
> Upon receiving a query:
> 
> The query is vectorized using the same embedding model.
> The closest vectors are retrieved from the vector database.
